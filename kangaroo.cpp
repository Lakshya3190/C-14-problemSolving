/*
There are two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward positive infinity). The first kangaroo starts at location x1 and moves at a rate of v1 meters per jump. The second kangaroo starts at location x2 and moves at a rate of v2 meters per jump. Given the starting locations and movement rates for each kangaroo, 
can you determine if theyâ€™ll ever land at the same location at the same time?
